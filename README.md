# ThermoAverage
Calculate Temperature with Thermistor taking the average of measured samples. 

### Requirements

Hardware: This library was developed to Arduino AVR 

Boards tested:

```
Arvuino Uno
Arduino Nano 328/168
Arduino Mini
```

Software: Any Arduino IDE >= 1.3.0 should be fine

### Hardware Installation

The ThermoAverage use any Analog Input.

The VCC can be 5 V or 3.3 V (better...).

### Library Installation

1. Download the ZIP file from https://github.com/marcialf/ThermoAverage/archive/master.zip
2. From the Arduino IDE: Sketch -> Include Library... -> Add .ZIP Library...
3. Restart the Arduino IDE to see the new "ThermoAverage" library.

See the comments in the example sketches for details about how to try them out.

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo


## Examples

This library including the following example:

[](exampleLICENSE)
1. DHT11Default: To sample the temperature and humidity.
1. DHT11WithRawBits: To sample the temperature and humidity, output the 40 raw bits.
